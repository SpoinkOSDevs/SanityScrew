# Unicorn++ Programming Language Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to Unicorn++, the most absurd and illogical programming language ever conceived! Unicorn++ was designed with the sole purpose of confusing and amusing programmers. It combines elements of brain-bending operations with a touch of magical realism to create a truly unique coding experience.

## Language Features

### Data Types

Unicorn++ supports the following data types:

- **Integer**: A single-byte integer stored in each memory cell of the tape.

### Operations

Unicorn++ provides a variety of absurd operations:

- **Increment (`🦄`)**: Increments the value at the current memory cell.
- **Decrement (`🌈`)**: Decrements the value at the current memory cell.
- **Move Right (`🧚‍♀️`)**: Moves the pointer to the right on the tape.
- **Move Left (`🐉`)**: Moves the pointer to the left on the tape.
- **Output (`🪄`)**: Outputs the ASCII character of the current memory cell.
- **Input (`🕳️`)**: Takes a character input and stores it in the current memory cell.
- **Output Text (`📝`)**: Outputs a string literal until the sequence `7` is encountered.
- **Variable Declaration/Assignment (`🖍️`)**: Declares or assigns a value to a variable.
- **Boolean Check (`🔍`)**: Checks if a variable equals a specified value.
- **Integer Input (`🍎`)**: Takes an integer input and stores it in a variable.
- **Variable Output (`👀`)**: Outputs the value of a specified variable.
- **Loop Start (`✨`)**: Starts a loop if the current memory cell is non-zero.
- **Loop End (`💫`)**: Ends a loop if the current memory cell is non-zero.
- **Rocket Launch (`🚀`)**: Launches a rocket (completely illogical!).
- **Use Toilet Paper (`🧻`)**: Uses toilet paper (because why not!).
- **Celebrate (`🎉`)**: Celebrates for no reason at all.
- **Summon Robot (`🤖`)**: Summons a robot (because every program needs one!).
- **Stop Everything (`🛑`)**: Stops everything (for emergency situations, like when a unicorn appears!).
- **Output Nonsense (`💩`)**: Outputs pure nonsense (because why be logical!).

### Syntax

- **Comments**: Lines starting with `#` are considered comments and are ignored.

### Variables

Variables in Unicorn++ are dynamically typed and can hold integer values. They are declared or assigned using the `🖍️` operator and accessed using the `👀` operator.

### Example Program

Here’s a classic "Hello, World!" program in Unicorn++:

```unicorn
🖍️ greeting 72
🖍️ offset 13
🦄
🦄
🦄
🦄
🧚‍♀️
✨
🌈
💫
📝 Hello, World!7
🪄
```

This program declares two variables (`greeting` and `offset`), increments `greeting` to reach ASCII value 72, moves the pointer right, starts a loop, decrements `greeting` to reach ASCII value 72, ends the loop, outputs "Hello, World!".

## Running Unicorn++

To run Unicorn++ programs:

1. **Interpreter Mode**: Execute a Unicorn++ program directly using the interpreter.
   
   ```bash
   ./unicornpp -R program.unicorn
   ```

   Replace `program.unicorn` with your Unicorn++ program file.

2. **Compilation Mode**: Generate a nonsensical C++ file (doesn't actually compile) from a Unicorn++ program.
   
   ```bash
   ./unicornpp -C program.unicorn
   ```

   This mode creates a `program.cpp` file that resembles C++ but is utterly meaningless.

## Options

- **-R <filename.unicorn>**: Run the specified Unicorn++ program file.
- **-C <filename.unicorn>**: Compile the specified Unicorn++ program file into a nonsensical C++ file.

## Notes

Unicorn++ is meant for entertainment purposes only and should not be used for any serious programming tasks. Have fun exploring the absurdity of Unicorn++ and embrace the chaos!

Feel free to add more whimsical features or expand on the absurdity as you see fit. Happy coding (or should we say, happy unicorn-ing)! 🦄
