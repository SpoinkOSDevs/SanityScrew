# SanityScrew Language

SanityScrew is a programming language designed for chaotic and unpredictable coding experiences.

## Language Overview

SanityScrew emphasizes randomness, unpredictability, and chaos in programming. It's designed to make code execution entertaining and unconventional.

## Commands

### Variable Operations

- `SET <var> <value>`: Set variable to a value.
- `ADD <var> <value>`: Add value to variable.
- `SUB <var> <value>`: Subtract value from variable.
- `MULT <var> <value>`: Multiply variable by value.
- `DIV <var> <value>`: Divide variable by value.
- `MOD <var> <value>`: Modulo variable by value.
- `RAND <var> <min> <max>`: Generate a random value between min and max and assign it to variable.

### Control Flow

- `IF <condition>`: Start an if block based on condition.
- `ELSE`: Else block in an if statement.
- `ENDIF`: End if block.
- `WHILE <condition>`: Start a while loop based on condition.
- `ENDWHILE`: End while loop.

### Input/Output

- `PRINT <var>`: Print variable value.
- `INPUT <var>`: Input value into variable.

### Timing and Interruptions

- `SLEEP <seconds>`: Pause execution for specified seconds.
- `WAIT <seconds>`: Same as SLEEP.
- `HIDE <comment>`: Hide a comment in code.
- `EXIT`: Exit the program abruptly.

### Special Effects

- `COOK <line_number>`: Reverse a line of code.
- `INJECT <var> <value>`: Inject value into a variable with random purity.
- `TRIP <var>`: Generate hallucinated values for a variable.
- `DUO`: An interactive dialogue with the Duolingo owl.
- `RICK`: Random Rick and Morty quotes.
- `SPAGHETTI`: Random spaghetti-related actions.
- `HEISENBERG`: Change program state unpredictably.
- `EXPLODE`: Modify code sequence unpredictably.
- `METHHEAD`: Introduce wild behavior.
- `OVERDOSE`: Abruptly end program execution.

### Fun Actions

- `KETTLE`: Boil the kettle.
- `CAR`: Drive a car.
